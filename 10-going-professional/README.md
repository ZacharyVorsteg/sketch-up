---

   - Shows: Basic modeling, materials, space planning
   - 3-4 images

---

### Portfolio Presentation Platforms

**Pros:**
- Professional domain (yourname.com)

**Cons:**

---

**Option 2: Portfolio Platforms (Easier Start)**

**Pros:**

accents, and a custom tile backsplash. The result 
is a bright, efficient space perfect for entertaining.

[3-5 images showing different views]
```

## Part 2: Pricing Your Services

### Understanding Your Value

**Common beginner mistake:** Underpricing

**Why it hurts:**
- Signals low quality
- Attracts problem clients
- Not sustainable
- Devalues industry

**Price based on value, not insecurity!**

---

### Pricing Models

**1. Hourly Rate**

**Formula:**
```
Desired Annual Income: $60,000
÷ Billable Hours/Year: 1,000 hours (realistic)
= $60/hour minimum

Add overhead (30%) = $78/hour
Add profit margin (20%) = $94/hour

Round to: $100/hour
```

**Beginner rates:** $50-75/hour  
**Intermediate:** $75-125/hour  
**Expert:** $125-250/hour

**Pros:**
- Flexible for scope changes
- Fair for unknown projects
- Easy to calculate

**Cons:**
- Penalizes efficiency
- Clients watch the clock
- Hard to predict earnings

---

**2. Fixed Project Rate (Recommended)**

**Process:**
1. Estimate hours needed
2. Multiply by hourly rate
3. Add 20% buffer
4. Quote fixed price

**Example:**
```
Kitchen design estimate:
- Initial consultation: 1 hour
- Concept development: 4 hours
- 3D modeling: 8 hours
- Revisions: 4 hours
- Final presentation: 2 hours
Total: 19 hours × $100 = $1,900
Buffer (20%): $380
Total quote: $2,280
Round to: $2,500
```

**Pros:**
- Client knows total cost
- You benefit from efficiency
- Professional
- Predictable income

**Cons:**
- Risk if scope grows
- Need accurate estimates
- Need clear scope definition

---

**3. Package Pricing (Best for Beginners)**

**Create service tiers:**

**Basic Package - $750**
- Single room design
- Up to 10' × 12'
- Basic modeling
- 5 final images
- 1 round of revisions

**Standard Package - $1,500**
- Multi-room design OR complex single room
- Full materials specification
- Detailed modeling
- 10 final images
- 2 rounds of revisions

**Premium Package - $3,000+**
- Full home/large commercial
- Complete specifications
- Photorealistic renders
- Unlimited images
- 3 rounds of revisions
- Contractor documents

**Pros:**
- Clear options for clients
- Easy to explain
- Upsell opportunities
- Predictable workflow

**Cons:**
- May not fit all projects
- Need clear scope limits
- Customization requests

---

### What to Charge For

**Always charge for:**
- ✅ Design time
- ✅ Modeling time
- ✅ Revision rounds

- ✅ Rush fees (< 1 week turnaround)

**Consider charging for:**

- ⚠️ Project management

**Never charge for:**
- ❌ Learning on the job
- ❌ Fixing your own mistakes

---

### Setting Boundaries

**Scope creep kills profitability!**

**In your contract, specify:**
- Number of revision rounds
- What's included vs. additional
- Response times
- Meeting limits
- Change order process

**Example clause:**
> "Package includes 2 rounds of revisions. Each additional round is $200. Major scope changes will require new estimate."

   - "Revision = changes to approved design"
   - "Major scope changes = new estimate"
3. **Charge for additional:**
   - "$150 per additional revision round"
4. **Have approval checkpoints:**
   - Approve layout before modeling
   - Approve materials before final renders

**In contract:**
> "Client approves layout. Then client approves materials. Then final renders produced. Changes after approval constitute additional revision rounds."
