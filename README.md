## 🎯 Course Philosophy

**This isn't just about clicking buttons.**

Every tool, every technique, every workflow has a **WHY** behind it. Understanding the reasoning makes you a designer, not just a button-clicker. That's what separates someone who can charge $50/hour from someone who charges $150/hour.

**You'll learn:**
- ✨ **WHAT** each tool does
- 🧠 **WHY** professionals use certain workflows
- 🎨 **HOW** to apply techniques correctly
- 💡 **WHEN** to use each approach
- 🚀 **WHERE** this fits in the professional world
