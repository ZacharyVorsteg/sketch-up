     └─ Critical for precision         └─ Listen to these!
```

---

### 1. Menu Bar (Top)

**File Menu** - Open, Save, Import, Export
- You'll use this for saving and exporting to clients

**Edit Menu** - Undo, Redo, Copy, Paste
- ⌘+Z (Mac) / Ctrl+Z (Windows) will be your best friend

**View Menu** - Toolbars, Camera settings
- Use this to customize your workspace

**Tools Menu** - All the modeling tools
- We'll learn each one systematically

**Window Menu** - Panels and dialog boxes
- Materials, Components, Styles live here

**Extensions Menu** - Plugins and add-ons
- This will be empty at first (we'll fill it later!)

---

### 2. Toolbars (Critical!)

These are your main tools. Let's activate the essential ones:

#### 🔧 How to Show Toolbars (SketchUp Pro):
- **Mac:** View → Tool Palettes → Large Tool Set
- **Windows:** View → Toolbars → Check these:
  - ✅ Getting Started
  - ✅ Large Tool Set
  - ✅ Measurements
  - ✅ Views

#### 📦 Main Toolbar Icons You'll Use:

| Icon | Tool | What It Does | When You Use It |
|------|------|--------------|-----------------|
| ➡️ | Select | Picks objects | Always (most used) |
| ✏️ | Line | Draws edges | Creating shapes |
| ⬜ | Rectangle | Makes rectangles | Walls, floors, surfaces |
| ⭕ | Circle | Makes circles | Columns, round objects |
| 🔼 | Push/Pull | Makes things 3D | **THE MAGIC TOOL** |
| ↔️ | Move | Moves objects | Repositioning |
| 🔄 | Rotate | Spins objects | Angles, orientation |
| 📏 | Tape Measure | Measures & guides | Precision work |
| 🎨 | Paint Bucket | Applies materials | Colors, textures |
| 🧐 | Orbit | Rotates camera | Viewing (ALWAYS) |
| ✋ | Pan | Slides camera | Adjusting view |
| 🔍 | Zoom | In/out | Focusing |

**Don't memorize this yet!** We'll learn each tool hands-on.

---

### 3. Modeling Window (Center)

This is your canvas. Key features:

#### The Axes (Red, Green, Blue)
```
         ↑ Blue (Up/Down - Vertical)
         |
         |
         └────────→ Red (Left/Right)
        /
       / Green (Forward/Back)
```

**WHY THIS MATTERS:**
- Red = Width (X-axis)
- Green = Depth (Y-axis)
- Blue = Height (Z-axis)

These axes help SketchUp understand what you're doing. When you draw along an axis, it "locks" to that direction. This is called **inference**.

#### Person Figure
- See that little person? That's "Sang" (the default model)
- She's there for scale reference
- She's about 5'6" (1.7m) tall
- You can delete her anytime (Select → Delete)

---

### 4. Measurements Box (Bottom Right)

This tiny box is POWERFUL.

**What it does:**
- Shows dimensions as you work
- Lets you type exact measurements
- Displays quick info

**Example:**
- Draw a line
- See the box say "12.5m" or similar
- Type "5" and hit Enter
- The line changes to exactly 5 units!

**🎯 Pro Secret:** Precision separates amateurs from pros. ALWAYS use exact measurements for client work.

---

### 5. Status Bar (Bottom Left)

This is SketchUp talking to you!

**It tells you:**
- What tool you're using
- What SketchUp expects you to do next
- Tips and hints

**READ THIS BAR!** It prevents 90% of beginner confusion.

Example messages:
- "Click to set first point of line"
- "Click to set next point or type length"
- "Click on a face to push/pull"

---

## Part 3: Essential Settings

Before you start modeling, let's configure some critical settings.

### 🎨 Template Settings

**Why this matters:** Templates set your units, style, and defaults.

1. Go to **Window → Preferences** (Mac) or **Window → System Preferences** (Win)
2. Click **"Template"**
3. Select: **"Architectural Design - Millimeters"**
4. Click **"Set as Default"**

**Why millimeters?**
- Most accurate for detail work
- Industry standard internationally
- Easy to scale (1mm = 0.001m)

---

### 🖱️ Mouse Settings (Critical!)

1. Go to **Window → Preferences**
2. Click **"Workspace"**
3. Check these settings:
   - ✅ "Click-drag-release to orbit"
   - ✅ "Create guides with Move tool" (Mac only)

---

### 💾 Auto-Save Settings (Save Your Life!)

1. **Window → Preferences**
2. Click **"General"**
3. Set **"Auto-save"** to **every 5 minutes**
4. Check **"Create backup"**

**Why:** SketchUp can crash. Auto-save has saved thousands of hours of work.

---

### 📐 Units Display

1. **Window → Model Info**
2. Click **"Units"**
3. Set to: **Millimeters**
4. Set Precision: **0.00mm**
5. Check **"Enable length snapping"** - OFF (important!)

**Why no snapping?** You want complete control, not SketchUp guessing.

---

## Part 4: Your First 3D Object

Time to create! We're making a simple box, but you're learning the fundamental SketchUp workflow.

### Exercise 1: The Magic Cube

**Goal:** Create a 3D cube that's exactly 1 meter × 1 meter × 1 meter

#### Step 1: Draw a Rectangle
1. Click the **Rectangle tool** (⬜ icon)
2. Look at the status bar: "Click to set first corner"
3. Click anywhere on the ground (red/green plane)
4. Move your mouse - see the rectangle forming?
5. **Don't click yet!** Instead, **type:** `1000,1000` then press Enter
   - *This creates a 1000mm × 1000mm rectangle (1m × 1m)*

**💡 What just happened?**
- You created a precise rectangle without clicking
- The measurements box accepted your input
- The comma separates width and length

#### Step 2: Make It 3D (Push/Pull Magic!)
1. Click the **Push/Pull tool** (🔼 icon)
2. Click INSIDE your rectangle (it highlights blue)
3. Move your mouse UP
4. Watch it become 3D! 🤯
5. Type: `1000` then press Enter

**🎉 YOU JUST MADE YOUR FIRST 3D OBJECT!**

#### Step 3: Orbit Around It
1. Click the **Orbit tool** (🧐 icon) or hold the scroll wheel
2. Click and drag in the modeling window
3. Your camera rotates around the cube!
4. **This is how you view your work from all angles**

#### Step 4: Save Your Work
1. **File → Save As**
2. Name it: `My_First_Cube.skp`
3. Save location: Create a folder called "SketchUp_Practice"

---

### Exercise 2: Understanding Faces and Edges

Let's understand what you just created.

#### Anatomy of 3D Objects:

```
Edge (Line)
    ↓
    ├────┐
    │    │  ← Face (Surface)
    │    │
    └────┘
```

**Your cube has:**
- **12 edges** (lines)
- **6 faces** (surfaces)

**Select Tool Practice:**
1. Click **Select tool** (➡️ arrow)
2. Click on one face - it highlights
3. Click on an edge - it highlights differently
4. Click in empty space to deselect

**Triple-Click Magic:**
1. **Triple-click** on your cube
2. The ENTIRE object selects!
3. This selects all connected geometry

**💡 Why this matters:** Understanding faces vs edges is critical for advanced modeling.

---

### Exercise 3: The Paint Bucket (Adding Color)

Let's make it look like something!

1. Click the **Paint Bucket tool** (🎨)
2. The **Materials Browser** opens
3. Click any color
4. Click on a face of your cube
5. The face turns that color!

**Try this:**
- Paint each face a different color
- See how you can identify faces clearly now?

**Undo practice:**
- Press ⌘+Z (Mac) or Ctrl+Z (Windows)
- Your last action undoes
- Press it multiple times to undo several steps

---

## Part 5: Essential Keyboard Shortcuts

Professionals barely use toolbars. They use keyboard shortcuts for speed.

### 🎯 Master These First:

| Shortcut | Tool | Why It's Critical |
|----------|------|-------------------|
| **Space** | Select | Always go back to select |
| **L** | Line | Most common tool |
| **R** | Rectangle | Quick rectangles |
| **C** | Circle | Quick circles |
| **P** | Push/Pull | The magic tool |
| **M** | Move | Reposition objects |
| **Q** | Rotate | Spin objects |
| **O** | Orbit | View your model |
| **Z** | Zoom Extents | See everything |
| **E** | Eraser | Delete edges |

### 🔥 Universal Shortcuts:

| Shortcut | Action |
|----------|--------|
| ⌘/Ctrl + Z | Undo |
| ⌘/Ctrl + Y | Redo |
| ⌘/Ctrl + S | Save |
| ⌘/Ctrl + C | Copy |
| ⌘/Ctrl + V | Paste |
| Delete/Backspace | Delete selected |

---

### Practice Drill: Speed Test

**Challenge:** Create a cube using ONLY keyboard shortcuts

1. Press **R** (rectangle tool)
2. Click, type `1000,1000`, Enter
3. Press **P** (push/pull)
4. Click the face, type `1000`, Enter
5. Press **O** (orbit) to view

**Time yourself!** With practice, you'll do this in 10 seconds.

---

## Part 6: Understanding the Interface Philosophy

### Why SketchUp Is Different

Most 3D software is complex. SketchUp is **intuitive**.

**The Core Philosophy:**
1. **Push/Pull** - Make flat things 3D by pushing/pulling
2. **Inference** - SketchUp guesses what you want
3. **Sticky Geometry** - Things connect automatically
4. **Components** - Reusable objects (we'll learn later)

**Example of Inference:**
- Move your mouse near an edge
- See it snap? That's inference
- See the colored dots at endpoints? Inference!
- See the "On Edge" tooltip? Inference!

**💡 Pro Tip:** Trust the inference engine. It's helping you.

---

## Part 7: Common First-Day Issues

### Issue 1: "I can't see my object!"
**Fix:** Press **Z** (Zoom Extents) - This shows everything

### Issue 2: "My tool won't work!"
**Fix:** Press **Space** to return to Select tool, then try again

### Issue 3: "I can't navigate properly!"
**Fix:** Check you have a mouse (not trackpad). Trackpads are very difficult.

### Issue 4: "SketchUp is too slow!"
**Fix:** Close the Materials panel if open. Don't work with complex materials yet.

### Issue 5: "Where did my toolbar go?"
**Fix:** View → Tool Palettes → Large Tool Set
